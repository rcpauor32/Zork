{"name":"Zork","tagline":"A horror version of the classic Zork (project)","body":"##Zork 0\r\n\r\n[Original Zork Link](http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/5zyoqrsugeopel3ffhz_vq/zork)  \r\n\r\n###Background:   \r\nThis zork is focused on a horror themed adventure.  \r\nThe main character wakes up in a bizarre world and has to escape from it. It is never directly said through the game but what is actually happening is the character is in a “after-death” kind of world and it is the way to the heaven.  \r\n\r\n###Items:  \r\n***3x marble*** --> They will be scattered on the map and are used in conjunction to open the room containing the stone skull  \r\n***lamp*** --> Will be used to illuminate the secret room and eliminate the darkness to actually do something in the room.  \r\n***teddy bear*** --> Give it to the girl and she will give you a marble back.   \r\n***stone skull*** --> You put it onto the angel statue to receive the stone heart after completing a puzzle.   \r\n***Red gem / blue gem*** --> Must be insterted in skull’s eyes before placing it on the statue.  \r\n***rusty key*** --> used to open the first room, it is a way to “teach” the player to seek in the game since it will be hide inside the body’s chest hole.  \r\n***stone heart*** --> it must be placed into the body’s hole to open the exit.   \r\n***newspaper sheet*** --> can be read and contains the code to enter the secret room.   \r\n***child notebook*** --> can be read and contains clues for the book puzzle and the name of the mysterious man (answer to his puzzle).    \r\n\r\n###NPC’s:  \r\n***Little Girl*** --> will give you a marble in exchange of the teddy bear. It is a representation of the main character’s daughter.   \r\n***Mysterious Creature*** --> will ask you to tell him his name (puzzle) and in exchange gives you the teddy bear. It is the embodiment of one of you daughter’s drawn characters.   \r\n***monster*** --> Will pursue you and kill you inside the dark room maze.  \r\n\r\n###Loss/Win Condition:  \r\nThere is no loss condition, you can die any amount of times, but you are back to the starter room so you won’t advance\r\nTo win you must escape the “building” (which is actually an “after-death” reality) you are in through the entrance door.  \r\n\r\n###Special Feature:  \r\nMore focused on narrative than Zork games use to and minigame-like puzzles.  \r\n\r\n###Game Map:  \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
